# Travel Time app

Aggregates data about commute travel time and computes an ideal leave time for a desired arrival time.

Uses maching learning to abstract some finer computational elements, leverage a growing data set, and capture finer features of contributing factors like weekly traffic patterns.

Ideally integrates with navigation platform (Google, Apple, etc?) to collect predicted travel time data and other finer-grain details about daily commutes.
